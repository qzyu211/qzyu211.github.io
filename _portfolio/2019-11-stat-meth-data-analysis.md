# China Gapminder Data Analysis

This is the final project for the Statistical Methods, Data Analysis course with Prof. Savkli in Fall '19 at JHU. The goal of the project is to explore the Gapminder data for a chosen country. The country chosen was China, and the project describes the evolution of the life expectancy versus income over time from 1800 C.E. to 2018 C.E. The methodology was to examine the plot of life expectancy against income through time and to analyze closely any changes in the pattern. The Gapminder data allows users to compare two variables on the $$y$$ and $$x$$ axes while using a sliding bar that represents the year for those variables. By using the sliding bar, it's possible to see how the two variables change over time. When new movements or patterns appeared in the interactive plot, the time frame of this change was then used to analyze the historical events during this period. China was analyzed through several periods, including: Qing dynasty, Civil War, and the founding of the People's Republic of China. In each of the periods, numerous sub-events were used to explain any of the significant changes in either the life expectancy or income. The final grade for the project is 100%.
