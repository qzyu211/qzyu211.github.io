The focus of this project is on the topic of ‘Density Estimation.’ For students that have studied some of the basics of probability and statistics, it’s simple to think of the real world through the lens of theoretical distributions that are easily generated from by utilizing a set of functions in RStudio (e.g., rnorm, runif, etc.). However, in the real world, phenomena that can be recorded as data may come from a variety of distributions that don’t fit well into the commonly covered probability distributions found in textbooks (e.g., normal distribution, Poisson distribution, binomial distribution, etc.). For example, it’s possible to think of the time between geyser eruptions for Old Faithful from Yellowstone National Park as being a random variable. The ‘true’ probability distribution function (i.e., the p.d.f. denoted f(x)) for this data is unknown, but it can be estimated using techniques from ‘Density Estimation.’ To be specific, the focus of this project will be on that of Kernel Density Estimation (K.D.E.).
